This is a quick morning project I created with python. I do not trust calorie tracking apps with my data. Normally I track calories and nutrition with my brain/calculator so I have made a quick python script to keep track. 

Right now the project consists of two classes, food and todayfood, which makes it easy to write to daily log files and keep track over multiple days. Food is an individual food object and todayfood opens the current day's log file. AddFood.py is a commandline runner, but there is definitely potential to add a GUI or other scripts to go over the data. 

To run the project save the files to a directory. Open the terminal, navigate to the directory, and run "python AddFood.py".
